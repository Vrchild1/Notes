### **1. Sole Trader**

**Advantages**:
- **Simple and inexpensive to set up**: Easy to start with minimal paperwork and legal requirements.
- **Complete control**: The owner makes all decisions and keeps all profits.
- **Low operating costs**: Fewer compliance and regulatory requirements, which means less overhead.
- **Easy to change or dissolve**: The owner can modify the business easily without the need for formal processes.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Unlimited liability**: The owner is personally responsible for all business debts, which means personal assets (like a house) could be at risk.
- **Limited capital**: Raising funds is harder since it relies on the owner’s personal savings or loans.
- **Limited expertise**: As the sole decision-maker, the owner may lack the knowledge or experience in all areas of running a business.
- **Workload and stress**: The sole trader must handle all responsibilities, often leading to long hours and high stress.

### **2. Partnership**

**Advantages**:
- **Shared responsibility**: Workload, decision-making, and risks are shared among the partners, which can reduce stress.
- **Increased capital**: More owners can contribute more resources, helping the business grow faster.
- **Diverse skills and expertise**: Partners bring different skills and experience, which can benefit the business.
- **Flexibility**: Partnerships can be easier to establish than companies and can have flexible management structures.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Unlimited liability**: In general partnerships, each partner is personally liable for the business’s debts, including debts caused by other partners.
- **Profit-sharing**: Profits are divided among the partners, which can sometimes cause conflicts.
- **Disagreements**: Conflicts can arise between partners, especially if they have different visions or work styles.
- **Limited lifespan**: If one partner leaves or dies, the partnership may need to be dissolved or restructured.

### **3. Private Company (Pty Ltd)**

- **Greater access to capital**: Can raise money through private investors or issuing shares to a small group.
- **Perpetual existence**: The company continues even if shareholders change or leave.

**Disadvantages**:
- **More regulation and paperwork**: Establishing a private company requires registration and ongoing compliance with government regulations.
- **Higher setup and running costs**: Setting up and maintaining a private company is more expensive than a sole trader or partnership.
- **Limited ownership**: Private companies can’t issue shares to the public, restricting the ability to raise large amounts of capital.
