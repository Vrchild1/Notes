### **1. Sole Trader**:
   - **Description**: A sole trader is a business owned and operated by one person. This is the simplest and most common business structure.
   - **Key Features**:
     - The owner has complete control over the business and keeps all profits.
     - There is no legal distinction between the owner and the business, meaning the owner is personally responsible for all debts and liabilities (unlimited liability).
     - Easy to set up with minimal legal requirements.
     - Examples include freelance workers, small retail shops, or individual consultants.

### **2. Partnership**:
   - **Description**: A partnership is a business owned by two or more people who share the responsibilities, profits, and losses.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Partners share control and decision-making.
     - Profits are usually distributed based on the partnership agreement.
     - Like a sole trader, partners have unlimited liability, meaning they are personally responsible for the business’s debts.
     - A partnership agreement usually outlines how profits are divided and how disputes are managed.
     - Partnerships can be general (all partners share equally) or limited (some partners have limited involvement and liability).

### **3. Private Company** (also known as a **Proprietary Limited Company** or **Pty Ltd** in Australia):
   - **Description**: A private company is a business structure where the company is privately owned by a small group of shareholders, and shares are not traded on the public stock exchange.
   - **Key Features**:
     - The company is a separate legal entity, meaning it can own property, incur debt, and be sued in its own name.
     - Shareholders’ liability is limited to the value of their shares (limited liability), so their personal assets are protected.
     - It can have up to 50 shareholders.
     - More complex to set up and manage than a sole trader or partnership, as it requires registration with government authorities and compliance with legal obligations like financial reporting.

### **4. Public Company**:
   - **Description**: A public company is a business structure where shares of the company are traded on the stock exchange and can be bought by the general public.
   - **Key Features**:
     - It is a separate legal entity from its owners (the shareholders), so it can own property, enter contracts, and sue or be sued.
     - Shareholders have limited liability (their personal assets are protected).
     - There are more regulations and reporting requirements than for private companies, as public companies must publish financial reports and follow strict corporate governance rules.
     - Public companies can raise large amounts of capital by issuing shares to the public.
     - Examples include large corporations like Apple or Coca-Cola.

### **5. Incorporated Association**:
   - **Description**: An incorporated association is a non-profit organization set up for specific community, charitable, cultural, or social purposes. It is a separate legal entity from its members.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Often used by clubs, societies, and non-profits.
     - Members are not personally liable for the organization’s debts or legal actions, as it has limited liability.
     - Must follow government regulations specific to non-profits, including regular financial reporting.
     - Any profits made are used to further the organization’s goals rather than being distributed to members.
